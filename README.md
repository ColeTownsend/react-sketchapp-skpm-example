# react-sketchapp-skpm-example

This is an example [`react-sketchapp`](http://github.com/jongold/react-sketchapp) plugin being built with [`skpm`](https://github.com/sketch-pm/skpm).

It renders a grid of `Swatch` components, and to make it interesting it dynamically computes a text color for each swatch.

## Running
```bash
npm install
npm run build # or npm run watch
npm run link
```

Open Sketch, and the plugin will be in `Plugins -> react-sketchapp-skpm-example`
